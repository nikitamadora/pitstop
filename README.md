### INTRODUCTION
    Life is full of surprises. And sometimes, it can be 
    really useful to know where the nearest restrooms are
    located!

    PitStop can give you a list of restrooms in your city, 
    and its database lives thanks to the community: users can add, 
    edit and delete restrooms to keep the list up to date!
